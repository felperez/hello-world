Tutorial

Hello! 

I'm Felipe Perez, PhD student of the University of Bristol and this is an attempt to set a git-hub to keep and share online the projects that I'm working on. My research consists mostly of ergodic theory and its relation to fractal geometry. My applied interests are mostly data analysis and machine learning methods.
